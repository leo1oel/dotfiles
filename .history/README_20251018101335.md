This repository contains my personal `Dotfiles`, managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## 🗂️ What are `Dot files`?
Dotfiles are plain-text configuration files on Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux, BSD, etc.) that control how applications, shells, editors, and tools behave. By version-controlling them, you can:

- **Customise your environment** → Tailor your shell, editor, and terminal experience.
- **Stay consistent across machines** → Clone this repo and instantly set up a familiar development environment anywhere.
- **Track changes** → Manage updates and experiment with new tools safely using Git.
- **Automate setup** → Save hours when setting up a new laptop, VM, or container.

## 🔧 Why chezmoi?

- Encrypted secret management.
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows via WSL).
- Easy initial setup on a fresh machine with a single command.

## 🙌 Why I Publish My Dotfiles

I believe in knowledge sharing and the open-source spirit. Publishing my `dotfiles` allows me to:

- **Document my setup** so I can reproduce it anywhere.
- **Help others** who are looking for inspiration to build or refine their own environments.
- **Learn and improve** by getting feedback and discovering better practices from the community.
- **Promote automation** — because a repeatable environment saves time and reduces friction.

If something here helps you speed up your workflow, that’s a win.
